      Lasagna is a delicious and popular Italian dish that consists of
      alternating layers of flat pasta sheets, savory meat or vegetable
      fillings, and rich, creamy cheese sauce. The pasta sheets are typically
      pre-cooked before being layered with ingredients like ground meat, such as
      beef or sausage, saut√©ed vegetables, such as onions, bell peppers, and
      mushrooms, and a variety of cheeses, such as mozzarella, Parmesan, and
      ricotta. These layers are then assembled in a baking dish and baked until
      the pasta is tender and the cheese on top is golden and bubbly. Lasagna is
      known for its hearty and comforting flavors, making it a favorite among
      pasta lovers worldwide. It is often served as a main course for family
      gatherings, special occasions, or enjoyed as leftovers for subsequent
      meals.
